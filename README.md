# Hah

A superlative rust-based arcade game.

Try to get over 20000 points! It's harder than it looks.

## Features

- Top-notch AI. Almost totally random!

## Dev TODOs

- [ ] Add some tests
- [ ] Maybe change the `trail` (background colour) to be a universal mapping of positions => colours.
- [ ] Allow baddies to have trails
- [ ] Improve baddie "AI"
